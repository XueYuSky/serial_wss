# Serial Wss

Serial WebSocket server that allows cross-platform access to serial ports using a JSON-RPC 2.0 based protocol

Is uses NW.js and chrome.serial API

The API exported is similar to the chrome.serial API. It allows listing the serial
ports available, connect to them and send/read binary data.

The idea was based on [https://github.com/chilipeppr/serial-port-json-server](Serial Port JSON Server) which unfortunately
only allows for text based data. Future implementation might be in Go too to avoid the huge
binaries generated by NW.js
